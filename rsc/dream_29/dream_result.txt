Dream description: The doors opened on their own, inviting me inside. The interior was grand, with golden chandeliers and marble floors. I walked through the halls, feeling a mix of awe and curiosity. At the end of a long corridor, I entered a room filled with ancient books and artifacts. A wise, old wizard appeared and handed me a book, saying it contained the secrets of the forest and my own hidden potentials.
