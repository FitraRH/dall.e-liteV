Dream description: I was walking through a dense forest at night, feeling lost and anxious. Suddenly, I stumbled upon an old, abandoned house. As I entered, I noticed the walls were covered with pictures of smiling faces. I felt a strange sense of calm and decided to explore further. In one of the rooms, I found a diary that seemed to belong to a little girl. The entries talked about her happy memories in that house. As I read, I felt a deep connection to her, and when I woke up, I couldn't shake the feeling of nostalgia and longing
