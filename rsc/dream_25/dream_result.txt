Dream description: I found myself standing at the edge of a dense, mystical forest. The trees were towering and seemed to whisper secrets among themselves. The air was thick with the scent of pine and blooming flowers. As I ventured deeper into the forest, I encountered a variety of magical creatures: a talking owl who offered wisdom, a playful group of fairies lighting the way with their sparkling wings, and a majestic unicorn that guided me towards a hidden waterfall.
