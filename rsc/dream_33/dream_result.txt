Dream description: I was standing in the middle of an enormous library, but instead of books, the shelves were filled with glowing glass bottles. Each bottle contained a tiny version of a memory from my life, swirling like liquid light. As I picked one up, it expanded in my hands and I found myself inside the memory. But things were strange—my childhood home was upside down, and the walls were made of water, gently rippling but holding their shape. I could see fish swimming through the furniture.
