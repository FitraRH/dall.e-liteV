Dream description: Next to the stream, there was an old wooden bridge. I hesitated for a moment but then decided to cross it. On the other side, I found a beautiful meadow filled with vibrant wildflowers of every color imaginable. The scent of the flowers was intoxicating, and I felt a sense of peace and joy.
