Dream description: I found myself in a massive, decaying palace made of bones and vines. The air was thick with the stench of rot, and every step echoed through the hollow halls. As I walked deeper, I realized the walls were alive—eyes blinking from within the bone structure, following my every move. Suddenly, I was pulled into a dark room where ancient, twisted figures whispered cryptic prophecies. Their voices grew louder, until I couldn’t breathe, trapped in the nightmare of endless whispers
