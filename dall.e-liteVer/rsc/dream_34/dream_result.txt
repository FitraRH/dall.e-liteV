Dream description: I was walking through a barren wasteland, where the ground cracked like dry skin, and the sky was a swirling mass of red and black clouds. In the distance, I saw a figure standing by a river that shimmered like black oil. As I approached, I realized it was the figure of Charon, the ferryman from Greek mythology, his hollow eyes gleaming under a hood. Instead of a boat, he stood beside a towering, rusted gate, which creaked as it slowly opened, revealing a path of jagged stones leading into an ancient underworld.
