Dream description: I was trapped in a massive, endless maze made of tall, stone walls covered in ivy. The sky above was dark and stormy, with flashes of lightning illuminating the labyrinth. I could hear the distant sound of heavy breathing and footsteps echoing through the maze. Panic set in as I realized I was being chased by something unseen. I ran as fast as I could, turning corner after corner, but the maze seemed to shift and change around me. Suddenly, I found myself in a dead end. I turned around to see a monstrous creature with glowing eyes and sharp claws approaching me. I tried to scream, but my voice was gone. Just as the creature lunged at me, I woke up in a cold sweat, heart racing.
