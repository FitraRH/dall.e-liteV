Dream description: I was walking through a park in my hometown. The weather was pleasant, neither too hot nor too cold. I noticed a few families having picnics and kids playing on the playground. I walked along a path lined with trees, enjoying the fresh air. I sat down on a bench for a while, watching people pass by. After some time, I decided to leave the park and head home.
