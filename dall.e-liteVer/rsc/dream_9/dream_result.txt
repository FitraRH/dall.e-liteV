Dream description: I was walking through a dense forest with tall, ancient trees. The sunlight barely penetrated through the thick canopy above, casting an ethereal glow on the forest floor. As I ventured deeper, I came across a hidden waterfall cascading into a crystal-clear pool. The sound of the water was soothing, and I felt an overwhelming sense of peace and tranquility. Suddenly, a majestic white deer appeared at the edge of the pool, its eyes reflecting the serenity of the place. We stood there for what felt like an eternity, simply gazing at each other, before it gracefully disappeared into the woods.
